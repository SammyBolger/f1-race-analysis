# 🏎️ F1 Race Analysis

A Python application for visualizing Formula 1 sessions using real telemetry data. 
The app provides a desktop GUI to select seasons, race weekends, and sessions, then launches an animated replay with interactive playback controls and driver telemetry overlays.

## 🚀 Features

- **Animated race replays** using real F1 telemetry data  
- **Desktop GUI** for selecting seasons, races, and sessions  
- **Live leaderboard** with tyre compounds and driver status  
- **Lap and time tracking** throughout the session  
- **Driver telemetry overlays** including speed, gear, and DRS status  
- **Interactive playback controls** via keyboard and on-screen buttons  
- **On-screen legend** explaining all controls

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **FastF1** for official telemetry and timing data  
- **PySide6 (Qt)** for the desktop GUI  
- **Arcade / Pyglet** for animated race visualization  
- **NumPy** for numerical processing

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SammyBolger/f1-race-replay.git
cd f1-race-replay
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

FastF1 will automatically create a cache folder on first run.
If it does not, manually create a folder named .fastf1-cache in the project root.

🙏 Acknowledgements

This project is based on the original F1 Race Replay project created by
Tom Shaw, This version builds on that foundation with additional UI, UX, and application flow improvements.

📈 Future Work

- ** Improve leaderboard accuracy during pit cycles and race start
- ** Expand qualifying and sprint session visualizations
- ** Add additional telemetry overlays and driver comparison tools
- ** Explore exporting replays or telemetry summaries
